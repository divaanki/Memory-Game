# MEMORY GAME

This project is a simple flip-flop card game where you have to match all the pairs of cards. A timer is set at the top which gives the amount of time taken to win the game and a counter is set which counts the number flips. If the number of flips becomes zero and the user is not able to turned all the matched cards then he loses the game otherwise he wins. The user gets a chance to restart the game with every win and loss if he wants to continue.

This game is simply build using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
